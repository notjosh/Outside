# Outside

A screensaver for seeing outside, into the Real Worldâ„¢

The file `videos.json` drives the playlist, which can be updated to consume other videos.

It's soothing though, so that's neat.

## Tasks

### Update `videos.json`

```sh
# first time: cd ./scripts/update-json && yarn
node ./scripts/update-json/index.js ./Outside/videos.json
```

### Release new build

```sh
agvtool new-marketing-version [version]
bundle exec fastlane release
```
